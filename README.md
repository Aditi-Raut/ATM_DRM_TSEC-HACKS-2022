# Digital-Rights-Management
This project was made during TSEC HACKS 2022 - A 24 hour hackathon. 

# Problem Statement
"Currently, there is no transparency in the way funds are transferred from the subscriber of a streaming service to the creator of the content, this can lead to services favouring some artists over others and small content creators being suppressed.
Instead, if Digital Rights Management (DRM) is based on a Blockchain, then there could be transparency in payouts for all artists. 
This could be proportional to how often the track is played or for the duration of time the content is played. By making this based on smart contracts and codifying the deal, there will be lesser disputes based on contract clause wordings."

Assume types of digital assets like audio, video, etc.
Keeping the third-party involvement transparent will also help increase peopleâ€™s trust in subscription services.

Additional features/suggestions:
1. Make various types of contracts such as view-only, re-distribute, etc.
2. Make provisions for artists to make contracts with others who wish to make remixes, etc. in order to make sure everyone is compensated for their work.
3. The ownership of the track can also be transferred to another record company. While doing so, make sure that the creator gets the royalty that they deserve.

# The problem DRM solves
In a centralized application(like Youtube), there is very less transparency of how the funds are transferred from the subscriber to the creator or from the company to the creator. They also have recommendation algorithms that tend to suppress less popular creators.

Our Decentralized application intends to bring an end to this vagueness.

Our app - DRM can be used by creators to post their content on our platform at the expense of minimal gas fees. The content can be in the form of audio,video and image. It makes use of a preemptive version of NFT minting known as hashing.
A user can open our platform and view the content, send funds to their favorite creator or even use their content with permission and minimal fees.
The cost of viewing and reusing a media depends on its current views. i.e. the more popular a content the more it will cost.
A company can also buy content from a creator, providing 0.2% royalties in return

1. Here, a subscriber can send funds directly to the creator without the involvement of a third party. It makes sure all transactions are transparent and can be easily tracked.
2. A creator can track who viewed their videos and the subscribers pay directly(and only) for the content they consume
3. It makes sure that a creator gets proper royalty for the redistribution of his/her work.
4. It doesn't suppress any artists and makes sure everyone receives their fair share of profits
